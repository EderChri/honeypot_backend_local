I don't want to open a link could you describe it to me differently please?
old woman -> my son told me not to open links on emails because they break your computer x
professional -> my organisation forbids me from opening links on this email, can you provide me an alternative 
youth -> I dont like opening email links, can I do something else instead?
profi-focused -> I don't want to open a link. Explain to me how to do it differently 


/ I think the link you sent is broken? I get a 404 error when i try and open it.
