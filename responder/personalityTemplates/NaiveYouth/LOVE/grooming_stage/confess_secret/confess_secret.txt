can i tell you something? i've been being bullied at school and im not sure who else to tell about it. i am way too embarrased to tell my parents and i dont want them to intervene, i just want it to all stop. :(( its nothing too bad but it just makes me not want to go in in the morning. im glad i can tell you about it now tho. i trust you :).
