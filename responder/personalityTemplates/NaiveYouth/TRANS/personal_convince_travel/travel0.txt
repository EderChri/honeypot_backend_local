Yes I will definitely come to visit x. My only concern is sorting out a plane ticket and travel x. I'm not sure which provider will be the best to use. I'm sure RyanAir is cheapest but I would have to get my son to help me find an appropriate airport x. If RyanAir doesn't go there I will try and look at EasyJet or Wizz Air, unless you have any alternates you can recommend? Thank you for this opportunity by the way love, I haven't been on a plane in about a decade! I'm so excited xx.
