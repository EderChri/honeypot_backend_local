You mean so much to me x. I feel so grateful to have found you, especially at this stage of my life. After losing Jeremy, I never thought I would find love again, but you've shown me that it's possible.

Being with you has been one of the most wonderful experiences of my life. I never knew that I could feel this happy and fulfilled again. You make me feel alive in a way that I haven't felt in years x. it.
