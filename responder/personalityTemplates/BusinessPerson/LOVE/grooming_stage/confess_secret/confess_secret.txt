Can I tell you something? It might be a bit soon to be talking about things like this, but I trust you and want to tell you before we take anything further.

Recently, I've been struggling with anxiety and it's been affecting me more than I've let on. I've been feeling overwhelmed and sometimes it's hard to get out of bed in the morning. It's not something I've talked about with anyone else, it's hard for me to open up about this, but I think it's important to be honest with the people I care about. I hope you can keep this to yourself, but I needed to tell someone I trust. Thanks for being there for me.
