I'm going to be visiting my sister tomorrow so my replies might not be quick x. She's just adopted an old yorkshire terrier, a seven year old dog but his pictures are adorable. I would send you some pictures but I've never never figured out how to send them on here, maybe when my son visits he can give me a tutorial x.
