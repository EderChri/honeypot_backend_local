Can I tell you something? It might be a bit full on but I want to get something off of my chest. 

After my husband died, I fell into a deep depression and I have never felt so alone. One night, I went out for a walk to clear my head and ended up at a bridge near our house. I stood there for what felt like hours, just staring at the water and thinking about everything that was going on. I was seriously considering how much easier my life would be if I could just end it.

I didn't, obviously. I eventually went home and the feelings eventually subsided. It's always followed me though, I never thought I'd find someone I trusted again after my husband passed. And I've never told anyone about it because I didn't want them to worry about me or think I was mad. 

I really feel like I can be honest with you x. I finally trust someone enough to tell them. I know it probably sounds silly but I'm really glad we have found this connection
